### **Developing a Sustainable Leisure and Tourism Destination**
SDC strives to develop the resort island as a leading leisure and tourism destination in a sustainable manner. While the past few decades have seen rapid changes to the island with extensive development works, many parts of Sentosa still retain the original tranquil and green environment.

This is because SDC has adopted a balanced and sustainable approach to the development and growth of Sentosa and constant attention has been paid to protecting the greenery, heritage and island charm
