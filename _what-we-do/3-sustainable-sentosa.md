### **Developing a Sustainable Leisure and Tourism Destination**
SDC strives to develop the resort island as a leading leisure and tourism destination in a sustainable manner. While the past few decades have seen rapid changes to the island with extensive development works, many parts of Sentosa still retain the original tranquil and green environment.

This is because SDC has adopted a balanced and sustainable approach to the development and growth of Sentosa and constant attention has been paid to protecting the greenery, heritage and island charm

Sentosa is home to some 27 heritage trees listed under the National Parks Board’s registry. Great efforts are made to protect and conserve them. Regular biodiversity surveys are conducted to monitor the health of the natural environment.

Sentosa also aims to keep 60% of itself as green and open spaces under the Island Conservation Policy.

#### **Protect and showcase island history and heritage assets**

Singapore’s only fully-restored fort, Fort Siloso, and over 30 conserved buildings are found on the island. Pre-war buildings and unique structures are re-purposed to give a second lease of life. Some buildings were built by the British and date back to the late 1800s. Similarly, some of our iconic but defunct Sentosa monorail stations have been converted into hotels, restaurants, attractions and offices, such as Sentosa Nature Discovery (previously Imbiah Monorail station).

#### **Promote sustainable tourism & responsible visitor behaviours**

Sentosa welcomes millions of visitors every year. This presents an opportunity for us to educate our visitors on the environment while they are having fun. In addition, all F&B outlets operated by SDC’s Business Units have removed shark’s fin dishes from their menus.

To raise awareness on pressing environmental concerns, Sentosa also participates in global efforts to raise awareness on climate change and water sustainability. For the past six years, SDC and its island partners have supported the World Wide Fund for Nature’s Earth Hour by switching off all non-essential lighting at Sentosa landmarks and Faber Peak Singapore for an hour. In 2016, Sentosa’s waterfront also lit up in hues of blue as The State of Fun commemorated Singapore World Water Day.
