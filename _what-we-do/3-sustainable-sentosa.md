### **Developing a Sustainable Leisure and Tourism Destination**
SDC strives to develop the resort island as a leading leisure and tourism destination in a sustainable manner. While the past few decades have seen rapid changes to the island with extensive development works, many parts of Sentosa still retain the original tranquil and green environment.

This is because SDC has adopted a balanced and sustainable approach to the development and growth of Sentosa and constant attention has been paid to protecting the greenery, heritage and island charm

### **Details of the Sustainability Plan**

#### **Enchance the island's ecology**

Sentosa is home to some 27 heritage trees listed under the National Parks Board’s registry. Great efforts are made to protect and conserve them. Regular biodiversity surveys are conducted to monitor the health of the natural environment.

Sentosa also aims to keep 60% of itself as green and open spaces under the Island Conservation Policy.

#### **Protect and showcase island history and heritage assets**

Singapore’s only fully-restored fort, Fort Siloso, and over 30 conserved buildings are found on the island. Pre-war buildings and unique structures are re-purposed to give a second lease of life. Some buildings were built by the British and date back to the late 1800s. Similarly, some of our iconic but defunct Sentosa monorail stations have been converted into hotels, restaurants, attractions and offices, such as Sentosa Nature Discovery (previously Imbiah Monorail station).

#### **Promote sustainable tourism & responsible visitor behaviours**

Sentosa welcomes millions of visitors every year. This presents an opportunity for us to educate our visitors on the environment while they are having fun. In addition, all F&B outlets operated by SDC’s Business Units have removed shark’s fin dishes from their menus.

To raise awareness on pressing environmental concerns, Sentosa also participates in global efforts to raise awareness on climate change and water sustainability. For the past six years, SDC and its island partners have supported the World Wide Fund for Nature’s Earth Hour by switching off all non-essential lighting at Sentosa landmarks and Faber Peak Singapore for an hour. In 2016, Sentosa’s waterfront also lit up in hues of blue as The State of Fun commemorated Singapore World Water Day. 

#### **Adopt environmentally-sustainable designs**

The advent of green design has highlighted methods in minimising the damage dealt to the environment through various architectural and design solutions. Many of Sentosa’s buildings are Green Mark certified, which is awarded by Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to environmentally-friendly buildings. 

#### **Maximise efficiency in use of energy and other resources**

Sentosa is exploring efficient and greener transportation methods which will reduce our carbon footprint, which includes building more sheltered walkways to encourage our visitors to explore the island by foot.

#### **Develop as a centre for green innovation and test beds**

            The island is well-positioned to be a “living laboratory” for test-bedding and green innovation. Research institutions, universities and companies are welcome to partner with us to experiment and test out suitable green ideas on the island.
            <br>
            In partnership with Philips Lighting, SDC has embarked on pilot-testing a new smart streetlight management system on the island. More than 250 conventional sodium streetlamps covering a distance of 3.4km along Artillery Avenue, Allanbrooke Road leading to Sentosa Cove and Bukit Manis Road were replaced.

We educate students and the wider public about Sentosa’s sustainability efforts, as well as ensure that underprivileged Singaporeans have the opportunity to experience the island’s leisure offerings. Since 2011, the island community has come together in our “Sentosa Gives” initiative during the September school holidays to welcome children from various Voluntary Welfare Organisations and charities in Singapore. The children are treated to a day of fun and activities on Sentosa.

For instance, close to 3,000 underprivileged members of the community benefited from the sixth edition of this initiative in 2016. On 27 August, 1,000 children and their family members had a memorable day on Sentosa, where they visited attractions of their choice and watched performances by local stars at Singapore Rhapsodies – The Concert. From 5-9 September, close to 1,500 beneficiaries from 31 voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) got to enjoy the ‘Sentosa Experience’ – a fun day out on the resort island, while another 139 secondary school students got the opportunity to preview a career in the tourism and leisure industry as they undertake a day of job-shadowing on The State of Fun, as part of the Youth-In-Action programme. 

#### **Build corporate culture of sustainability thinking**

Staff campaigns and educational talks are regularly organised to spread awareness on environmental issues. This includes inviting speakers from organisations such as the Nature Society (Singapore). We also have experiential activities, such as a regular beach cleanup for staff, to encourage everyone to appreciate environmental issues and take personal responsibility.
