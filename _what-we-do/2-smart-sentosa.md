Beyond building the island as a fun destination for all, SDC seeks to leverage new technologies and solutions to continuously enhance guest experience. As an active test-bed for innovations, Sentosa has established multiple collaborations with both the private and public sectors to create and test-bed new technologies and solutions. Visitors to the island can thus look forward to enhanced experiences in the near future as we develop a Smart Sentosa ecosystem.

### **SDC-IMDA Collaborations**
As Singapore pushes towards becoming the world’s first Smart Nation, we aim to improve the quality of life for individuals and business productivity of enterprises by tapping on the potential of technology. The Infocomm & Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) and SDC are collaborating to co-innovate and develop technology that addresses real-life problem statements and make a positive impact on the tourism and hospitality sector, such as improving integrated guest experiences and improving operational efficiency.

#### **Integrated Guest Experience (iGX@Sentosa)**

		<p>
			A joint innovation challenge was issued to the local tech community to integrate guest experience on a single platform from pre-visit to post-arrival, allowing for seamless and personalised enjoyment on The State of Fun. Out of more than 30 proposals, six solutions were shortlisted for prototyping, including a pocket concierge, audio-to-text assistant, emotion recognition, wearables, seamless payment gateway, virtual reality as well as deep learning analytics.

#### **Integrated Operations (iOPs@Sentosa)**

Under the iOPs@Sentosa Innovation Challenge, we invited the tech community including local tech companies, IHLs and research institutes to submit proposals and ideas for quick prototyping, Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) and pilots to address issues in island operations and guest’s perspective on the areas of Transport, Queue and Mobility. The development process takes place in early 2017.

Staying true to its commitment to provide visitors with a fun, convenient and value-added experience, Sentosa has expanded its on-island coverage of Wireless@SG since February 2016. Currently, there are more than 200 access points across the island, a 70 per cent increase since Wireless@SG was launched on the island resort in mid-2014.

This free coverage has extended to expansive outdoor areas – visitors can now enjoy seamless Wi-Fi connection while basking in the sun on the beachfronts of Palawan Beach and Siloso Beach; as well as Fort Siloso Skywalk. To enable visitors to stay connected while travelling between attractions, the Wi-Fi service now also extends to all stations of the Sentosa Express (Sentosa, Waterfront, Imbiah and Beach) and the Sentosa Line of the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network (Merlion, Imbiah Lookout, Siloso Point), Sentosa Golf Club (Clubhouse and Pavilion) and Palawan Kidz City.

In partnership with IMDA, Sentosa has also launched a pilot initiative to trial outdoor Wi-Fi powered by solar energy at the Merlion Walk. The trial, which ends in September 2017, will allow for outdoor Wi-Fi to be expanded in a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable manner.

### **Enchanced Mobility with Self-driving Vehicles**

		<p>
			In October 2015, SDC inked a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Transport and Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd to conduct tests for a point-to-point mobility-on-demand transportation service in Sentosa using self-driving vehicles. In the near future, guests will be able to travel around the island using the self-driving shuttles, called from their smart phones or via information kiosks. Complementing existing on-island transport options, these self-driving vehicles will improve connectivity and accessibility for commuters on the island.
