Beyond building the island as a fun destination for all, SDC seeks to leverage new technologies and solutions to continuously enhance guest experience. As an active test-bed for innovations, Sentosa has established multiple collaborations with both the private and public sectors to create and test-bed new technologies and solutions. Visitors to the island can thus look forward to enhanced experiences in the near future as we develop a Smart Sentosa ecosystem.

### **SDC-IMDA Collaborations**
As Singapore pushes towards becoming the worldâ€™s first Smart Nation, we aim to improve the quality of life for individuals and business productivity of enterprises by tapping on the potential of technology. The Infocomm & Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) and SDC are collaborating to co-innovate and develop technology that addresses real-life problem statements and make a positive impact on the tourism and hospitality sector, such as improving integrated guest experiences and improving operational efficiency.

#### **Integrated Guest Experience (iGX@Sentosa)**

A joint innovation challenge was issued to the local tech community to integrate guest experience on a single platform from pre-visit to post-arrival, allowing for seamless and personalised enjoyment on The State of Fun. Out of more than 30 proposals, six solutions were shortlisted for prototyping, including a pocket concierge, audio-to-text assistant, emotion recognition, wearables, seamless payment gateway, virtual reality as well as deep learning analytics.
