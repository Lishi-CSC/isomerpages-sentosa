### **Unique Leisure Experiences**
Catering to different facades of fun, Sentosa’s development plans are carved out into different zones, each with its unique characteristics and cater to the diverse needs of our guests. SDC also continues to strengthen Sentosa’s ‘always on’ calendar of events to create year-round buzz on The State of Fun. From festive celebrations to signature events such as Sentosa FunFest, Sentosa Celebrates Music and the year-end Siloso Beach Party, we aim give our visitors more reasons to visit Sentosa, time and again.

The Imbiah Lookout and Merlion area currently offers an eclectic mix of both active as well as passive nature-based experiences. These range from the adrenaline pumping MegaZip and Skyline Luge ride set against the natural terrain of Imbiah, to the culturally-rich Images of Singapore LIVE! and educational Sentosa Nature Discovery, where guests can explore the island’s rich biodiversity and walking trails. Easily accessible via the Sentosa Express and Singapore Cable Car Sky Network, the hub also offers various retail and food and beverage (F&B) options.
