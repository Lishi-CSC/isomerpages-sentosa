In May 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was inked between Sentosa Development Corporation and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), marking the start of a three-year partnership that provides NTUC members with year-long advantages on Sentosa, The State of Fun. 
This partnership is expected to benefit some 50,000 union members, who can enjoy an exciting array of privileges on Sentosa, including discount on admissions to attractions such as the Sentosa Merlion, Wings of Time, as well as signature events such as the Sentosa FunFest, and the year-end Siloso Beach Party. 

#### **Sentosa HarbourFront Business Association**

As a founding member in the Sentosa HarbourFront Business Association (SHBA), SDC works closely with other stakeholders within the Sentosa HarbourFront precinct to foster collaboration and sharing of best practices amongst members, as well as to develop the precinct as an integrated waterfront lifestyle destination for business and leisure. This includes the creation of new precinct-wide events such as “The Great Egg-Venture at Sentosa HarbourFront” held annually for Easter.
