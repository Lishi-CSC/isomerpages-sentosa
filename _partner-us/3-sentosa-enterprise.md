### How It Works

Sentosa x Enterprise offers a win-win partnership, where innovators and enterprises benefit from a risk-sharing arrangement while working on projects that could boost Sentosa's vibrancy and attractiveness.

Sentosa island is being offered as a testbed venue to innovators and enterprises to bring innovative or novel ideas, concepts or technology that require Proof-Of-Concept.

Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) is prepared to fund up to S$100K to support Proof-Of-Concept costs, co-share rental expenses, set-up of supporting infrastructure and facilitation of resources.
