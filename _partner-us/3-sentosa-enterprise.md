### How It Works

Sentosa x Enterprise offers a win-win partnership, where innovators and enterprises benefit from a risk-sharing arrangement while working on projects that could boost Sentosa's vibrancy and attractiveness.

Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) is prepared to fund up to S$100K to support Proof-Of-Concept costs, co-share rental expenses, set-up of supporting infrastructure and facilitation of resources.
